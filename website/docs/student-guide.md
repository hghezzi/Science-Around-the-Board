## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

### Movement & Properties
* **Roll Dice:** Move your token.
* **Unowned Property:** If you land on a research topic nobody owns, you can attempt to "Publish" (buy) it.
    * *The Quiz:* You must answer a question correctly.
    * *Success:* You can choose to pay the cost and own the tile.
    * *Failure:* You pay a small penalty and do not get the tile.
* **Owned Property (Rival):** If you land on a tile owned by another team, you must pay **Rent**.

### Rent Defense (The "50% Rule")
When you owe rent, you have a chance to defend your funding:
* **The Defense Question:** You must answer a question related to that topic.
* **Correct:** You proved your knowledge! You pay only **50%** of the rent.
* **Incorrect:** You pay the **Full (100%)** rent.

### 🧪 Upgrades (The "Monopoly" Mechanic)
You can upgrade your labs to charge massive rent, but strict rules apply:
1.  **Group Ownership:** You must own **ALL** tiles of a specific color group (e.g., all 3 "Side 1" tiles).
2.  **Even Building:** You must upgrade evenly. You cannot build a Level 3 tile if the others in the group are still Level 0.
3.  **How to Build:** Click the **"Lab Manager"** button to buy upgrades and multiply the rent charged to other players.

### ⚡ Chaos Tokens
Chaos Tokens introduce "Take That" mechanics to the game.
* **How to get them:** Earn one by capturing a Milestone. After all Milestone tiles are owned, chaos tokens can be purchased for $500.
* **How to use them:** Click **"Use Chaos"** -> Select a rival's property.
* **The Duel:** You face a question related to the tile you are trying to steal:
    * *Success:* You **STEAL** the property for 50% of its value.
    * *Failure:* You pay a fine to the bank.

### Bankruptcy
If you run out of money (Negative Balance):
1.  **Liquidation:** The game will force you to sell assets or downgrade labs until you are positive.
2.  **The Bailout (Grant):** If you sell *everything* and are still in debt, you apply for an Emergency Grant.
    * *The Cost:* You receive $500 to keep playing.
    * *The Penalty:* **You are disqualified from the Mastery Victory.** You can still play, but you cannot win the main objective.
