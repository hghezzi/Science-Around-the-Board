# Science Around the Board

**Science Around the Board** is an open-source, customizable board game engine designed to gamify higher education. 

Originally developed to teach bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia, it has evolved into a **subject-agnostic platform**. Whether you are teaching History, Physics, Literature, or Coding, this engine allows you to turn your curriculum into a competitive, "Monopoly-style" strategy game.

## The Core Concept

Traditional review sessions (like multiple-choice quizzes) are often passive. **Science Around the Board** transforms assessment into a social, high-stakes strategy experience:

* **Active Recall:** Students must answer *your* questions to acquire territory and defend resources.
* **Resource Management:** Players balance "Funding" (Score) to upgrade their capabilities.
* **Peer Learning:** The mechanics encourage debate and discussion before committing to an answer.

## Key Features

* **Universal Content Engine:** The game is driven by a simple Excel/TSV file. If you can write a question, you can make a game.
* **Zero-Install:** Runs entirely in the browser. No IT support or server setup required.
* **Privacy-First:** No student data is stored. Custom images load locally from the instructor's computer.
* **Assessment Ready:** Built-in Pre- and Post-game confidence surveys measure learning outcomes automatically.

## Quick Start

1.  **Customize:** Download the question template and fill it with your course content.
2.  **Launch:** Open the web app and upload your file.
3.  **Play:** Students join as "Research Teams" (or any group identity you prefer) and compete to master the material.
