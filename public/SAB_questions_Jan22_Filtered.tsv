prop_seq_mech_06	How does 'Paired-End' sequencing differ from single-end sequencing?	It sequences two different samples at once	It sequences DNA and RNA simultaneously	It sequences the same strand twice	It sequences both ends of a DNA fragment	4	"Paired-end sequencing reads the fragment from the 5' end, flips it over (turnaround), and reads it again from the 3' end to provide coverage of both sides."	16S	QIIME2	Amplicon sequencing	Sequencing	property

Paired-end 150 bp	Single-end 300 bp	Paired-end 300 bp	Single-end 400 bp	3	"To cover 460bp with overlap, you need a total read length > 460bp. Paired-end 300bp (300+300=600bp) is the only option that bridges the gap."	16S	QIIME2	Amplicon sequencing	Sequencing	milestone	
mile_seq_mech_04	Why do we add unique barcodes to samples before pooling them for a single run?	To improve the quality scores of the run	To increase the total amount of DNA	To allow us to demultiplex the samples in QIIME2	To physically separate them in the lane	3	"Pooling lowers cost, but mixes the physical DNA; unique indices allow the computer to digitally separate the data back into individual samples."	16S	QIIME2	Amplicon sequencing	Sequencing	milestone	
mile_seq_mech_08	What is an advantage of Paired-End sequencing over Single-End sequencing?	It can cover larger variable regions	It is significantly cheaper	It produces twice as many clusters	It is faster to run	1	"Paired-end sequencing allows you to merge reads to cover larger gene regions (like V3-V4), providing more sequence information for accurate taxonomy assignment."	16S	QIIME2	Amplicon sequencing	Sequencing	milestone

Microbiome refers to genes; Microbiota refers to the organisms	Microbiota refers to genes; Microbiome refers to the organisms	They are exactly the same term	Microbiome is for viruses only; Microbiota is for bacteria	1	"While often used interchangeably, strictly speaking, Microbiota is the organisms, while Microbiome refers to their collective genetic material (genomes)."	16S	QIIME2	Amplicon sequencing	16S rRNA	property	
mile_16s_04	Why is it necessary to target specific regions like V3-V4 (approx 460bp) rather than the whole 16S gene (1500bp) for Illumina sequencing?	The whole gene is too conserved to provide identification	The V3-V4 region is the only variable part	The whole gene cannot be amplified by any type of PCR	Illumina read lengths are too short to span the full gene	4	"Standard Illumina reads (e.g., 2x300bp) are too short to bridge the full 1500bp gene, so we must target smaller sub-regions like V3-V4."	16S	QIIME2	Amplicon sequencing	16S rRNA	milestone

"It is present in all bacteria, functionally constant, and contains both conserved and variable regions"	It mutates very rapidly to show recent changes only	It is unique to pathogenic bacteria	It is a protein-coding gene subject to selection	1	"It is perfect because it is universal (present in all bacteria) yet accumulates neutral mutations at a slow, constant rate, allowing us to measure evolutionary time."	16S	QIIME2	Amplicon sequencing	16S rRNA	survey	
prop_q2_arch_02	"In the command `qiime tools import`, what role does `tools` play?"	It is the name of the input file	It is the plugin (subset of commands) being called	It is the specific action being performed	It is the name of the output directory	2	"In the standard syntax `qiime <plugin> <action>`, the word `tools` is the plugin responsible for general file operations."	16S	QIIME2	QIIME Foundations	Import & Architecture	property

mile_q2_arch_10	Why does QIIME 2 wrap data in Artifacts (.qza) instead of using standard FASTQ files throughout the pipeline?	To make the files smaller	To prevent you from opening them	To track provenance (history) and ensure interoperability between plugins	To make it harder to use	3	"The Artifact system forces all data to carry its history (provenance) with it, ensuring reproducibility and preventing file format compatibility errors."	16S	QIIME2	QIIME Foundations	Import & Architecture	milestone	
post_arch_survey_04	You have demultiplexed paired-end data in a directory. You try to import it using `--type EMPSingleEndSequences`. Why does QIIME 2 reject this or fail later?	The files are too large	QIIME 2 cannot handle paired-end data	The directory is read-only	"The semantic type does not match the data structure (Paired vs Single, Demux vs Multiplexed)"	4	"QIIME 2 enforces ""Semantic Types""; you cannot trick it into accepting paired, demuxed data when it expects single, multiplexed data."	16S	QIIME2	QIIME Foundations	Survey	post

prop_q2_dn_02	What is the fundamental difference between DADA2 and Deblur algorithms?	DADA2 is for paired-end only; Deblur is for single-end only	DADA2 uses a reference database; Deblur does not	DADA2 detects and corrects errors; Deblur detects and removes error-containing reads	Deblur corrects errors; DADA2 removes error-containing reads	3	"DADA2 uses a probabilistic model to *correct* sequencing errors, while Deblur uses error profiles to *filter out* erroneous reads."	16S	QIIME2	QIIME Foundations	Denoising & QC	property

mile_q2_dn_08	You are comparing your study to a paper published in 2013 that used 97% OTUs. Can you directly compare your ASVs to their OTUs?	"Yes, they are the same"	"No, OTUs rely on reference databases and thresholds"	"Yes, if you divide by 97"	Only if you use Deblur	2	"OTUs are subject to reference bias and clustering algorithms; ASVs are exact. You cannot directly compare ""fuzzy"" clusters to ""exact"" variants."	16S	QIIME2	QIIME Foundations	Denoising & QC	milestone

It should be much shorter than your reads	It should be much longer than your reads	It should match the biological read length	It does not matter for classification	3	The reference sequences should mimic the physical reads to ensure the k-mer patterns are comparable.	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	Taxonomy	milestone	
mile_tax_bio_09	Why might a valid biological sequence be labeled 'Unassigned'?	It is a known pathogen	It is a primer dimer	It is a sequencing error	It represents a novel microbe	4	"Databases are incomplete. 'Unassigned' often represents ""Microbial Dark Matter""—organisms not yet cataloged by science."	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	Taxonomy	milestone

survey_tax_bio_03	"If you change PCR primers, what must you do to the classifier?"	"Nothing, it is universal"	Use a different database	Re-train on new primers	Rename the old classifier	3	Classifiers are region-specific. A V4 classifier cannot recognize V1-V3 sequences because the patterns differ.	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	Taxonomy	survey	
survey_tax_bio_04	What is the main risk of keeping 'rare features' in your data?	The file size is too big	They inflate diversity metrics	They reduce the read count	They cause taxonomy errors	2	Diversity metrics count every unique feature. Keeping noise (rare errors) creates a falsely high estimate of richness.	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	Taxonomy	survey

A visualization (`.qzv`) of the barplots	A new Feature Table with taxonomy added	A Taxonomy artifact (`taxonomy.qza`) linking Feature IDs to taxonomic names	A phylogenetic tree	3	The classifier produces a specific `FeatureData[Taxonomy]` artifact (`taxonomy.qza`) that maps each feature hash to a taxonomic string.	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	QIIME analysis	property	
prop_tax_q2_03	"To create a visual Taxa Barplot, which two artifacts (files) MUST be provided as inputs?"

prop_tax_q2_04	What does the command `qiime metadata tabulate` do with the `taxonomy.qza` file?	It filters the taxonomy	It converts it into an interactive visualization (`.qzv`) that can be viewed	It trains the classifier	It merges it with the table	2	This command is used to turn the raw data artifact into a human-readable table (visualization) for inspection.	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	QIIME analysis	property

To determine the colors of the bars	To allow sorting and grouping of samples by experimental categories in the visualization	To filter the data	To name the output file	2	The metadata file allows the visualizer to group samples (e.g. by 'Treatment') rather than just listing them alphabetically.	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	QIIME analysis	property	
mile_tax_q2_01	"You run `classify-sklearn` but get an ""invalid input"" error. You used `--i-reads table.qza`. Why did it fail?"	"The command requires the Metadata file, not the Table"	The command requires the Tree artifact	The file extension should be .qzv	The command requires the Representative Sequences file (rep-seqs.qza).	4	"The classifier works on DNA sequences.

mile_tax_q2_05	"Why is it best to remove samples with low read counts AFTER filtering features (e.g., mitochondria)?"	Feature filtering does not affect sample counts	You should filter samples first	It makes the file larger	Feature filtering can leave some samples empty	4	Removing abundant features (like host DNA) can leave some samples empty.

The database is wrong	The primers are wrong	The classifier learned shorter patterns than the data contains	The classifier is too accurate	3	"The reference sequences should match the length of your query sequences. Training on 150bp means the classifier ""learned"" shorter patterns than it is seeing in your 250bp data."	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	QIIME analysis	milestone	
mile_tax_q2_09	"If you have a 'Taxonomy' artifact (`taxonomy.qza`) but no 'Feature Table', can you generate a Barplot?"	"Yes, if you have metadata"	"No, you need the tree"	"No, you need the Table to provide the counts"	"Yes, the taxonomy is sufficient"	3	"A list of names (Taxonomy) tells you *what* is there, but without the Table, you don't know *how much* of it is there to draw the bars."	16S	QIIME2	Taxonomic diversity	QIIME analysis	milestone	
mile_tax_q2_10	"When filtering features, why is a percentage threshold (e.g. <0.01%) often preferred over a hard count?"	It removes more data	It keeps more data	It accounts for differences in total sequencing depth	It is harder to calculate	3	A count of 10 is negligible in a dataset with 100 million reads but significant in one with 1000 reads.

Community A has higher richness than Community B	Community B has higher evenness than Community A	Community A is more diverse due to higher evenness	Community B is more diverse due to dominant species	3	"While Richness is identical (5 species), Community A is ecologically more diverse because its Evenness is higher."	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	Diversity	milestone	
mile_div_bio_02	Why is 'Observed Features' a poor metric for distinguishing communities with different evolutionary histories?	It is too sensitive to evenness	It requires a phylogenetic tree	It cannot handle large datasets	It treats all species as equally distinct	4	"Observed Features is just a count; it sees ""E. coli vs Salmonella"" (close relatives) as equally distinct as ""E. coli vs Fungus"" (distant)."	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	Diversity	milestone	
mile_div_bio_03	What does it mean when the alpha rarefaction curve plateaus (flattens out)?	You have sequenced enough to capture most diversity	You have not sequenced enough to capture diversity	The sample has very low quality scores	The sample contains no bacterial DNA	1	A plateau indicates saturation: further sampling (sequencing) is just re-observing the same species over and over.	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	Diversity	milestone	
mile_div_bio_04	You want to determine if communities differ specifically by the presence of *rare* taxa. Which metric is best?	Weighted UniFrac	Bray-Curtis	Unweighted UniFrac	Shannon Index	3	"Unweighted UniFrac ignores abundance, so a rare species (count=1) has the same weight as a dominant one, highlighting presence/absence shifts."	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	Diversity	milestone	
mile_div_bio_05	"In a PCoA plot, what does 'PC1 (57%)' tell you compared to 'PC2 (12%)'?"	Axis 2 is more important for clustering	Axis 1 explains most of the variation	Both axes are equally important	The percentages represent error rates	2	"The first principal coordinate (PC1) always captures the largest possible variance in the data, making it the most critical axis for interpretation."	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	Diversity	milestone

Because the phylogeny is diverse	Because the sample size is small	Because the community is very even	Because the community is uneven	4	"Shannon accounts for evenness.

survey_div_bio_04	Why is the 'q-value' (FDR) often more relevant than the raw 'p-value' in diversity analysis?	It corrects for multiple testing errors	It is easier to calculate manually	It is always smaller than the p-value	It ignores the sample size	1	"In microbiome datasets with many taxa or groups, a raw p-value yields many false positives.

High F implies strong separation between groups."	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	QIIME application	milestone	
mile_div_q2_10	You want to compare Alpha Diversity between 'Male' and 'Female' using the metadata column `Sex`. What command do you run?	`qiime diversity beta-group-significance --m-column Sex`	`qiime diversity alpha-group-significance --m-metadata-column Sex`	`qiime diversity core-metrics --p-sex male`	`qiime taxa barplot --m-metadata-column Sex`	2	You must specify the metadata file and the specific column (`Sex`) you want to test against the diversity vector.	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	QIIME application	milestone	
survey_div_q2_01	"In QIIME2, why is the `core-metrics-phylogenetic` pipeline preferred over running `alpha`, `beta`, and `pcoa` commands individually?"	It ensures all metrics use the exact same rarefied table for consistency	It is more accurate than running them separately	It allows for different depths per metric	It uses a better tree for calculation	1	Running one pipeline guarantees that every single metric (Alpha and Beta) is calculated from the exact same randomly subsampled dataset.	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	QIIME application	survey	
survey_div_q2_02	"If the rarefaction curve for 'Group A' allow you to plot a higher max depth than for 'Group B', what does this imply?"	Group A is more diverse than Group B	Group B is contaminated with host DNA	The rarefaction calculation failed	Group A was sequenced more deeply than Group B	4	"The x-axis represents sequencing depth. If Group A's line goes further to the right, those samples simply had more reads available."	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	QIIME application	survey	
survey_div_q2_03	You are advising a student who wants to exclude samples with < 1000 reads *before* diversity analysis. How do you do this in QIIME 2?	Use `qiime feature-table filter-samples` with `--p-min-frequency 1000`	Use `core-metrics` with `--p-sampling-depth 1000`	Use `taxa filter-table` to remove low counts	Delete the samples manually from the folder	1	"While `core-metrics` drops low-read samples automatically, explicitly filtering the table first is a cleaner way to create a robust dataset for analysis."	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	QIIME application	survey	
survey_div_q2_05	"Why is it important to use a ""Sample Metadata"" file when running `alpha-group-significance`?"	To set the colors of the boxplots	The command uses the metadata groups to perform the statistical test	To name the output visualization	To filter the table before testing	2	The command cannot guess your experimental design. The metadata file tells it which samples belong to which group for statistical comparison.	16S	QIIME2	Diversity metric	QIIME application	survey

core_unix_01	Which character sequence represents the 'parent directory' (one level up) in a file path?	`/`	`~`	`..`	`.`	3	"In UNIX navigation, `..` always refers to the directory immediately above your current location, while `.` refers to the current directory."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_02	What is the defining feature of an 'Absolute Path' compared to a 'Relative Path'?	It starts with a forward slash `/` (root directory)	It starts with the current directory	It is shorter to type	It contains no spaces	1	"An absolute path (e.g., `/home/user/data`) defines the full location from the system's root directory `/`, whereas a relative path starts from where you are currently standing."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_03	You are typing a long file name. Which key can you press to auto-complete the name after typing the first few letters?	Enter	Tab	Space	Ctrl+C	2	Tab completion is a critical shell shortcut that saves time and prevents typos by automatically filling in file paths that match what you've typed.	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_04	You want to verify which directory you are currently working in. Which command prints the 'Present Working Directory'?	`getwd`	`ls`	`cd`	`pwd`	4	`pwd` (Print Working Directory) outputs the full absolute path of your current location in the file system.	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_05	"What is the effect of putting a space in a filename (e.g., `my data.fastq`) without quoting it?"	The shell interprets it as two separate arguments (`my` and `data.fastq`)	It works perfectly fine	It deletes the file	It creates a directory	1	"Spaces are delimiters in UNIX. To use a file with a space, you must escape it (`my\ data.fastq`) or quote it (`""my data.fastq""`)."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_06	You see a file path listed as `~`. What does the tilde `~` symbol represent?	The root directory	The user's home directory	The temporary directory	The trash directory	2	"The tilde `~` is a shorthand alias for the current user's home folder (e.g., `/home/student/`)."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_07	Which command is used to list the contents (files and folders) of the current directory?	`show`	`ls`	`open`	`view`	2	`ls` (LiSt) is the standard command to display the contents of a directory.	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_08	You typed a complex command incorrectly. How can you quickly retrieve the previous command from your history to edit it?	Press the Up Arrow key	Press Ctrl+Z	Press the Down Arrow key	Type `history -1`	1	"The Up Arrow key cycles backward through your command history, allowing you to recall and fix mistakes without retyping the whole line."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_09	What does the backslash `\` character do when placed at the very end of a command line?	It executes the command immediately	It deletes the previous word	"It acts as a line continuation, telling the shell the command continues on the next line"	It cancels the command	3	"The backslash escapes the ""Enter"" key (newline), allowing you to break a long command into multiple readable lines."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_10	"You try to run `QIIME` but get ""command not found"". You know it is installed. What is the likely cause of the error?"	You need to restart the computer	"UNIX is case-sensitive, and the command is lowercase `qiime`"	You are in the wrong folder	You need to type `run QIIME`	2	"Unlike Windows, UNIX commands are strictly case-sensitive. `QIIME` is not the same as `qiime`."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_11	"What is the wildcard character used to select ""all files"" matching a pattern (e.g., all files ending in .fastq)?"	`?`	`#`	`*`	`@`	3	"The asterisk `*` is the wildcard that matches any string of characters, so `*.fastq` selects every file ending with that extension."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_12	You want to organize your files. Which command creates a new directory (folder)?	`newdir`	`mkdir`	`touch`	`rm`	2	`mkdir` (MaKe DIRectory) is the command used to generate new folder structures in the file system.	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_14	"If you run a command and receive ""File not found"", but you can see the input file in your file browser, what is the most common mistake?"	The file is locked	The file path to the input file is incorrect	The file is corrupt	The internet is down	2	"Commands look in the `pwd` (current directory). If the file is elsewhere, you must provide the path or `cd` to that directory first."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_15	"How do you navigate ""down"" into a subfolder named `data`?"	`cd ..`	`ls data`	`go data`	`cd data`	4	`cd` (Change Directory) followed by the folder name moves your context into that folder.	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_16	What visual cue does the terminal provide to indicate a command is still running and has not crashed?	"The prompt `$` or `>` does not reappear, and the cursor may blink"	The screen turns blue	"It prints ""Done"" immediately"	It makes a beeping sound	1	"As long as the command prompt (usually ending in `$`) hasn't returned, the foreground process is still active and working."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_18	What is the general difference between a flag with one dash `-i` and two dashes `--input`?	"One dash is for outputs, two for inputs"	"One dash is for short-form (single letter), two dashes are for long-form (full word)"	"One dash is optional, two are mandatory"	There is no difference	2	"By convention, single-letter aliases use `-` (e.g., `-h`), while full-word options use `--` (e.g., `--help`)."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_19	You want to read the help manual for the `mkdir` command. What would you type?	`mkdir --help` or `man mkdir`	`help me mkdir`	`? mkdir`	`info mkdir`	1	"Most UNIX tools support `--help`, and `man` (manual) opens the full system documentation for standard commands."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core	
core_unix_20	Why does QIIME 2 usually require you to specify `--o-output-dir` or `--o-table` filenames?	To allow you to name your result files something meaningful	Because it is not possible for qiime to invent names	To overwrite your raw data	To delete the inputs	1	"Unlike graphical apps that might auto-save, UNIX tools require you to explicitly define where results go and what they should be called."	16S	QIIME2	Core	UNIX	core
