q001	"Which extraction method is generally most effective for Gram-positive bacteria, and why?"	"Chemical lysis only, because it is gentle."

q004	"When assessing DNA purity, what does a 260/280 ratio of ~1.8 indicate?"	Heavy RNA contamination.	Significant protein contamination.	Relatively pure DNA.	Severe DNA shearing.	3	A ratio near 1.8 indicates pure DNA.	16S	Overview	Sample Prep	Quality Control	property
q005	"If your DNA sample shows a 260/280 ratio of 1.4, what is most likely contaminating it?"	High RNA	Residual protein	High salt	Pure DNA	2	Low 260/280 suggests protein or phenol contamination.	16S	Overview	Sample Prep	Milestone	milestone
